# Welcome to Spacefarers!

---

This is a simple dashboard where the admin user can create, read, update, and delete data displayed on the List Report
Page.

The application uses CAP (Cloud Application Programming) framework, Fiori List Report and Object Page (powered by
SAPUi5), along
with an SQLite database and mocked authentication.

## Data Model

This model represents a galactic Spacefaring organization where Spacefarers are structured within a hierarchical
system.

Each Spacefarer is assigned to one Position, and each Spacefarer belongs to one Intergalactic Department.
(many-to-one relationships)

Additionally, each Spacefarer has attributes such as name, origin planet, stardust collection, spacesuit color, and
wormhole navigation
skills.

## Form validation

Both frontend form validation *(@mandatory name)* and backend validation *(before CREATE and UPDATE for the stardustCollection and wormholeNavigation properties)* are implemented.
